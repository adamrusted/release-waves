# Release Waves as Markdown files

A client I work with likes to have a wiki page set up with all the upcoming changes, and how they might impact their business. I've created this repo in order to keep a master copy of this information handy - so that I can iterate over it as new release waves come around!

## How to use

1. Download a copy of this repo
2. Download your the branch of your ADO Wiki you'd like to add the documentation to.
3. Copy the `Release-Waves` folder into the root (or wherever you want!) within your ADO Wiki
4. Update the `Expected Impact` column on each table, as well as the `Impact` heading under each change to reflect the potential impact to your client.
5. Commit and push your changes!

## 2024 Release Wave 1 Completion

The initial commit of this repo only contains products relevant to the client I am working with. I will continue to update the repository with additional information as-and-when it becomes relevant.
