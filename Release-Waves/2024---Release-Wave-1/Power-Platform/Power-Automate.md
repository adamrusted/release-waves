# Cloud flows

## Be more productive with Power Automate and Excel desktop

This feature provides access to prebuilt templates and allows users to build workflows quickly and easily using a native automation capability in Excel desktop on Windows and Mac. An example of the template includes "Monitor incoming emails to an alias in an Excel worksheet" that businesses can use to keep track of customer feedback in Excel. This makes it easy to respond to customers' needs and improves satisfaction.

This capability supersedes the Automate a Task capability by introducing an integrated experience in Excel. These capabilities are different from the flow add-in.

## Receive intelligent license recommendations for admins

Admins can:

1. Receive intelligent license recommendations with a list of users based on:
    - License requested by users
    - Trial users
    - Seeded users without premium license
    - Active users without premium license
2. Automatically assign licenses to the selected users directly or through a security group

## View a Power Automate visual in a Power BI report

When you create a Power Automate visual in a Power BI report, your users can run an automated flow, just by selecting a button in your report. The flow can be data contextual, meaning that the flow inputs can be dynamic, based on the filters the users set.

You can later edit the flow with different data fields to use as data inputs. You can also change formatting, such as button text, font color, font size, or fill color of the button. You can enable permission for any user to edit the flow, in addition to running it.

This feature is currently in public preview and documented in [Create a Power Automate visual for Power BI (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/power-bi-automate-visual?tabs=powerbi-desktop).

With the general availability update, you can see flows outside the Default environment and support for all regions Power Automate is available in.

# Process Mining

## Ingest process data from customers' data lakes

You now have a choice to enable Power Automate Process Mining to connect directly to your Azure data lake with your existing data pipelines. This eliminates steps of data transformation or porting across sources, enabling easier data ingestion. Direct connection to your Azure data lake also enables scaling process data to hundreds of gigabytes.

# Desktop flows

## Use Power Platform connectors in Power Automate for desktop actions

As a maker, you're now able to use more than 1,000 cloud connectors, currently available in cloud flows, straight through desktop flows. This feature helps reduce logical loops and minimize flow creation time. It also helps ensure all actions capabilities are available through desktop flows for the Power Platform connectors.

## Set up fallback UI automation mechanism

The fallback automation mechanism feature provides a reliable solution for UI and browser automation actions. Users can set up a fallback mechanism for UI automation actions in case the UI element cannot be found through the set selector(s). This mechanism can fall back to image recognition or other techniques as screen understanding. To enable the feature, users should do it either on action level or flow level. From the respective setting, they can enable the feature and set up their preferred fallback options. This feature is designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of automation processes and offers a reliable and flexible solution for UI and web automation, helping businesses to streamline their operations and improve their bottom line.

## Power Fx integration with Power Automate for desktop

Power Fx is the low-code language for expressing logic across Microsoft Power Platform. It's a general-purpose, strong-typed, declarative, and functional programming language. Power Fx is expressed in human-friendly text. It's a low-code language that makers can work with directly in an Excel-like formula bar or Visual Studio Code text window. The "low" in low-code is due to the concise and simple nature of the language, making common programming tasks easy for both makers and developers.
