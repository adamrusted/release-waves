# GPT prompt builder

## Author power cards with GPT prompts

You can revolutionize data visualization with natural language prompts. The prompt builder empowers makers to transform GPT prompts into visually appealing power cards. This feature bridges the gap between complex AI outputs and user-friendly visualizations, making it effortless to integrate and display generative AI capabilities. Makers can leverage these enhanced power cards across various touchpoints, providing a seamless and intuitive way to present GPT outputs as self-contained, interactive components within their applications.

### Impact

[[Expected impact to your client.]]

## Build the perfect response with copilot in prompt builder

Crafting the ideal GPT prompt is now more intuitive and less technical with the integration of conversation experience in the prompt builder. This feature leverages a dialogue-based approach, transforming prompt engineering into a conversational and user-friendly experience. Makers can engage in natural, flowing dialogues to construct complex prompts, capitalizing on the expanded token limits and advanced functionalities of the latest LLMs. This re-envisioned approach not only simplifies the prompt creation process, but also makes it more accessible, enabling makers to efficiently generate sophisticated instructions for GPT.

### Impact

[[Expected impact to your client.]]

## Classify content with AI prompts grounded in Dataverse data

With this new capability, makers can reference Dataverse data records to their GPT prompts, allowing users to classify content based on past data. In prompt builder, a new option is available to add a data source into GPT prompts. Users can then select specific Dataverse records to include in the prompt, along with specific instructions on how to match incoming content and which category to return.

### Impact

[[Expected impact to your client.]]

## Define specific output formats with prompt builder

Prompt builder gives you the possibility to generate and test specific output formats directly in the AI Builder prompt builder experience. This allows makers to use prompt builder across multple scenarios that go beyond text generation. Supported output formats are Power Cards, Power Fx, and JSON formatting.

### Impact

[[Expected impact to your client.]]

## Prompt builder supports few-shot learning and validation

Few-shot learning is a prompt engineering technique where the model is given a small number of examples, typically between two and five, in order to quickly adapt to new examples of previously seen objects. With this new feature, you can provide specific examples of data inputs directly in prompt builder to help craft the correct prompt that produces optimal output.

### Impact

[[Expected impact to your client.]]

# Extend copilot capabilities with AI

## Customize copilot Q&A with AI prompts from Dataverse

With this new capability, makers can add Dataverse data records to their AI prompts, allowing users to get insights.

In prompt builder, a new option is available to add a data source into AI prompts. You can then select specific Dataverse records to include in the prompt, along with specific instructions regarding the type of summary to produce, classfication to perform, or answers to provide.

### Impact

[[Expected impact to your client.]]

## Copilots can process and generate documents

As a first step, you can attach a file to the AI Builder **Create text with GPT** experience.

- Option to attach a file in the prompt builder dialog.
- Attach files with a maximum size limit (less than the max prompt size limit).
- Extract file text with OCR and include it as part of the prompt instruction.

### Impact

# Governance and administration

## Enable pay-as-you-go for AI Builder

Pay-as-you-go for AI Builder provides greater flexibility for admins to deploy AI Builder within their organizations. This new system based on usage consumption gives admins options to manage AI Builder in their environments:

- **Keep pay-as-you-go disabled:** Pre-purchase AI Builder capacity and allocate AI Builder units to individual environments.
- **Enable pay-as-you-go:** AI Builder credits no longer need to be allocated to environments for makers to use AI Builder, and organizations will be charged based on usage.

Admins can set consumption limits on select environments to maintain control over how much AI Builder capacity is used by makers.

### Impact

# AI governance and administration

## Monitor LLM activity logging for makers and admins

Admins can use AI Builder model activity data in Dataverse to monitor inputs and outputs of their text generation models and prompts, either through the Power Automate AI Builder activity page, the Dataverse table, or by connecting their own reporting to the Dataverse data.

### Impact

[[Expected impact to your client.]]

## Model datasets support application lifecycle management

Model datasets support application lifecycle management (ALM), which allows makers to retrain custom models once they've been deployed to different environments.
