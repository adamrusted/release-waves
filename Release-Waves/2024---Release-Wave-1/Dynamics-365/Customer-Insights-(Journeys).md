## Get faster insights at scale with auto-management of segments, measures

When you have large numbers of segments and measures, as an admin, you can't determine which are needed and which are not. A lot of the campaigns could be one-time campaigns where the segments or measures are not needed after a period of time.

When the segment or measure isn't used anywhere else after the retention period, the system can now automatically deactivate it. This moves compute resources to the segments and measures that are active, which results in faster system refresh and thus faster time to insights.

Users can reactivate segments or measures if needed.

### Impact

<!-- Expected impact to your client. -->

## Improve reliability of insights with advanced bot protection

- **Prevent bot clicks on your emails:** Avoid inflated engagement metrics, incorrectly triggered journeys, and skewed analytics.
- **Protect web forms visits, clicks, and submissions:** Web forms can be targeted by bots looking to submit spam or malicious content. Bot protection helps ensure that only legitimate form submissions are recorded and no journey is triggered falsely.
- **Ensure accurate event attendance:** Event check-ins can be targeted by bots looking to falsely inflate attendance metrics. Bot protection helps ensure that only real attendees are recorded.

### Impact

<!-- Expected impact to your client. -->

## Collect extra customer information without creating custom attributes

- Use custom fields to capture additional or temporary information like meal preference or an answer to a contest question.
- To use custom form fields, simply drag and drop them from the toolbox to the form canvas and edit the label and properties as you wish.
- The answer is stored only as part of the form submission, so you can access the value any time without polluting your data.

### Impact

<!-- Expected impact to your client. -->

## Provide varied experiences in one journey using journey split tiles

The journey split tile creates branches in your journey to split up the participant population and provides them with different experiences. You can either split by percentage or by number, each of which supports up to 25 branches.

- **Split by percentage:** Breaks the audience up randomly into the percentages associated with each branch. The random assignment is done for each participant individually, therefore, this works best for larger populations (more than 2,000 participants). This option is useful for scenarios that need randomness, such as sending an experience survey to a subset of your customers.
- **Split by number:** Fills up branches from left to right based on how many participants are configured to go down each branch. This is best for scenarios that need specific numbers of participants, such as offering a promotion for the first 1,000 customers that sign up for a newsletter.

### Impact

<!-- Expected impact to your client. -->

- Take automated action every time a lead hits certain qualification criteria.
